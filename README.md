## Why is Donnut So Awesome? (Glad you asked!) üòã

Donnut isn't just another platform; it's a whole new flavor of support! We've cooked up something special to solve real problems for fans and creators:

* **Freedom of Flavor (Donate Any Crypto, From Any Chain!):**
    Got some ETH on Ethereum? DAI on Polygon? No problem! Fans can send donations using virtually *any cryptocurrency* from *any blockchain*. No more "Oops, wrong token!" moments. We use Blockscout to discover all available tokens on each chain (with spam filtering for a better experience).
* **One Sweet Reward for Creators (Hello, USDC on Your Preferred Chain!):**
    Creators, rejoice! Forget managing countless tokens and wallets. All those diverse fan donations magically transform into USDC (a stable, reliable digital dollar) and land right in your wallet on your preferred chain. By default, we use Arbitrum, but you can choose any supported chain!
* **Multiple Links for Different Purposes:**
    Creators can create and manage multiple donation links, each with its own label. Perfect for organizing donations for different projects, platforms, or purposes. All links are stored securely in our Neon PostgreSQL database.
* **Smart Analytics Dashboard:**
    Keep track of your success! Our creator dashboard provides detailed statistics about your donations, including transaction history per link and overall performance metrics. All transaction data is sourced directly from Blockscout for complete transparency.
* **Baked with Transparency (See it All!):**
    No hidden ingredients here! Every step of the donation journey is visible and verifiable through Blockscout. Trust is our main ingredient.
* **No Secret Recipe (Easy for Everyone!):**
    New to crypto? No worries! Donnut boasts an intuitive web app. The donation form is as simple as choosing a token, amount, and adding your message. We make Web3 feel like a walk in the park (or a trip to the donut shop!).
* **More Crumbs for Creators, Fewer Bites for Fees:**
    Traditional platforms can take a hefty slice. Donnut uses 1inch Fusion+ for optimized token conversion, minimizing commission bites and ensuring you get the best rates possible.
